# This file is a Makefile for Tk.  If it has the name "Makefile.in",
# it is a template for a Makefile; to generate the actual Makefile,
# run "./configure", which is a configuration script generated by the
# "autoconf" program (constructs like "@foo@" will get replaced in the
# actual Makefile).

# Things you can change to personalize the Makefile for your own
# site (you can make these changes in either Makefile.in or
# Makefile, but changes to Makefile will get lost if you re-run
# the configuration script).

# Default top-level directories in which to install architecture-
# specific files (exec_prefix) and machine-independent files such

# at configure-time with the --exec-prefix and --prefix options
# to the "configure" script.
